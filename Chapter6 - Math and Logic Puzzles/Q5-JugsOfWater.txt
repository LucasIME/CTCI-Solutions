The initial conditions are: we have a 5/4 jug, a 3/4 jug, unlimited water and our goal is to get exactly 4/4 of water.
We'll describe every state with a pair of how much each jug has, starting with (0,0).
1- We first fill the 3/4 all the way to the top. (0, 3/4)
2- We put everything from the 2nd jug in the 1st. (3/4, 0)
3- We fill in the 2nd jug again. (3/4, 3/4)
4- We put as much water as we can from the 2nd jug into the 1st one, until it's full. (5/4, 1/4)
5- We throw all the water away from the 1st jug. (0, 1/4)
6- We put all the reamining water from the 2nd jug into the 1st one. (1/4, 0)
7- We fill in the 2nd jug again. (1/4, 3/4)
8- We deposit everything from the 2nd jug into the 1st. (4/4, 0)

Now, we are done and achieved 4/4 of water.
