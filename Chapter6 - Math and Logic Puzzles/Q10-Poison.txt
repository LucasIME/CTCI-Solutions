We can discover the poison bottle in 7 days.
All we need to to is, for each bottle, get the number N written in the label, check its binary form and put a drop of the liquid in a stripe whenever there is a 1 in the binary representation.
This way, in the 7th day the number of the poison bottle will be written in its binary form in the stripes.
