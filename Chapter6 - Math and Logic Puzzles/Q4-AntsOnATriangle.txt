For no ants on a n-vertex polygon to collide, all of them have to choose the same direction.

That is, after the 1st ant chooses any direction, all the other ants have to pick this same direction.

Therefore, the probability of no collisions is P1= (0.5)^(n-1)

Then, the chance of having collisions is: P = 1 - P1 = 1 - (0.5)Ë†(n-1)

For the Triangle: P = 3/4
